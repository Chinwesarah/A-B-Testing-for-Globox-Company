# A-B-Testing-for-Globox-Company
A/B testing for a new banner on the Company's mobile website to investigate its effect on revenue and conversion rate.
## Project Overview
The Company introduced a new banner that highlights key products in the food and drink category at the top of the mobile website to see if it leads to increased revenue and conversion rate. A user visits the main page and is randomly assigned to either the control (does not see new banner) or treatment (sees new banner) groups. Users may or may not make purchase, making purchase is termed ‘conversion’. The experiment ran for 13 days
## CONTEXT
1. Two metrics were measured in this experiment, conversion rate and average amount
spent per user.
2. Users were assigned randomly to two groups, group A(control) and B(treatment).
3. There was a total of 48,943 users, 24,343 in group A and 24,600 in group B.
4. 955 users made purchase in group A and 1,139 in group B.
5. The total amount spent by customers in group B was higher than group A with $1,269  The conversion rate in group B was higher than group A with 0.71%
6. **Two Hypothesis tests** were further carried out to determine whether there is a
statistically significant difference between the two groups and rule out the possibility that the above listed results were due to chance. For the difference in means (average amount spent per user), a two-tailed T-test with a 95% confidence level and 0.05 as threshold for statistical significance was conducted. For the difference in proportions (conversion rate), a two-tailed Z-test with a 95% confidence level and 0.05 as threshold for statistical significance was conducted.
7.** A power analysis** was also carried out to determine whether the total number of users (sample size) in the experiment was adequate to detect meaningful effects. The purpose of this analysis was to determine not only the statistical significance of the difference between the two groups but also how meaningful and practical it is in the
