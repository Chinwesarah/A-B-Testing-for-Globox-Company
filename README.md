# A-B-Testing-for-Globox-Company
A/B testing for a new banner on the Company's mobile website to investigate its effect on revenue and conversion rate.
## Project Overview
The Company introduced a new banner that highlights key products in the food and drink category at the top of the mobile website to see if it leads to increased revenue and conversion rate. A user visits the main page and is randomly assigned to either the control (does not see new banner) or treatment (sees new banner) groups. Users may or may not make purchase, making purchase is termed ‘conversion’. The experiment ran for 13 days
